I've been resolving some exercises from https://www.jschallenger.com/, in order to improve my knowledge and get more skills.

There are different ways to resolve each exercises, I've been trying to put my knowledge in practice with every one of those exersices, searching and reading differents methos that havascript give us, some exercises are really complicated so sometimes it takes me a long time to resolve them, and sometimes I ask help from my friends.

At the same time, I'm trying to do the same exercises but in this case, I'm using python.
